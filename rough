Dear Chetna,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to let you know that unfortunately, I am not feeling that well today to go to office and believe it would be best for me to work from home today. I will ensure an active participation throughout the day.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
Km Indu
